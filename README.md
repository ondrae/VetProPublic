VetProPublic
============

A cross platform mobile app to help farmers with instructions for their medicines.

Check out the development version at http://www.ondrae.com/VetProVisionsApp/

The code base is currently private as I'm developing it for a private client.

This javascript app uses the fantastic http://build.phonegap.com/ service to create identical Android and iOS versions.

Data is handled through the incredibly easy to use http://parse.com service.

The UI is all http://jquerymobile.com/ to keep it easy and uniform.
